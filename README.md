**NYC Neighborhood Internet Adoption**

(Income, Internet and NYC Boroughs analysis)

**Description**

For our final project we have decided to explore internet availability around 
New York City. Society in the United States has reached a point where internet 
is widely available to everyone and is a driver of our economy. Along with this,
we have seen a rapid growth in internet availability around the country. However,
as history has shown, resources are often not equitably divulged across society.
For this reason we believe that there may inequitable trends in internet availability 
(internet adoption) around New York City.

In order to test these aspects, we have gathered data from NYC Open Data that has information
on internet adoption and availability by geographical area in New York City.
This information paired with other datapoints in NYC Open Data that has demographic data
based on geographic location across the city, will hopefully uncover these inequitable
trends. 

The variables in the demographic data include:
- average income per neighborhood/borough
- population per neighborhood/borough
- etc.

The variables in the internet adoption data include:
- type of internet available in each neighborhood/borough
- speed of internet in each neighborhood/borough
- etc.

In both of these data sets there are borough and neighborhood code information. 
By combining the data on either of these columns we will be able to compare and contrast the 
demographic data with the internet adoption data. 

There are both quantitative and categorical data in these data sets so we will
potentially use a variety of visualization techniques to discover these trends and patterns. 

**Problem statement:**

Is there a trend in internet adoption based on demographic data across New York
City?
