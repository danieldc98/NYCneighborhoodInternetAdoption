# Conclusion

We have explored the relation of internet availability and various socioeconomic features of neighborhoods throughout the five boroughs of New York City. In doing so, we discovered some trends in availability and adoption of internet that indicate the shortcomings of Mayor De Blasio's "Internet Master Plan". 

Looking at internet adoption and availability by boroughs, we found that the best internet coverage is in Manhattan. Staten Island and Brooklyn have mid to high level internet adoption, while Queens comes in slightly higher than the Bronx, but both at the bottom of the list. We came to this conclusion using data on internet adoption and availability, internet speed availability, public hot spot availability and mobile internet dependency. 

One of our most concerning findings is the relationship between mean neighborhood income and internet availability/adoption. Overall, a higher income in a neighborhood correlates with better internet availability and adoption. This trend continues when looking at race, housing and other demographic features. First, it is important to note the there are several demographic features that are closely correlated in society: number of children is correlated to poverty rates, rental prices and home values are correlated to income and often times, and neighborhoods in cities are often predominantly made up of a single race/ethnicity. With that being said, we found a correlation between these demographic features and internet adoption and availability.

These trends show that areas such as the Bronx, with the highest poverty rates and lowest income, have the lowest internet adoption and availability rates. This is contrasted with Manhattan, which has the highest income levels as well as the best internet coverage and adoption. The other demographic factors fall in line with these correlations as well.

Our findings show that New York City has yet to meet Mayor de Blasio's Internet Master Plan goals of equitable internet access across the city.  While the COVID-19 pandemic may have stifled progress towards carrying out the plan, the "aggressive infrastructure bill" has failed to meet its goals thus far. 

We learnt a lot of useful lessons while working on this NYC Neighborhood Internet adoption project not only developing our technical skill set in R but also identifying the key drivers for the internet adoption in different boroughs. Gaining valuable insights into NYC demographics, promoters and detractors features, internet prevalence statistics, democratized access and learning about bias by building data stories was both challenging and interesting.
As it is said, we are surrounded by data and we starve for insights, thinking and navigating through this project helped us learn a lot.

There are some limitations to this study, Data availability and accuracy is always a challenge. In this case the internet data is from 2021. There is a chance that there have been some major improvements in internet infrastructure since then. Also, New York City is a rapidly changing city, especially coming out of the pandemic so there is a chance that our demographic data is also out of date. One way to improve this analysis would be to compare and contrast previous years of internet data with this years to see if there has been a change in the internet adoption and accessibility since the announcement of the "Internet Master Plan" since its announcement.

For future directions on this project, we anticipate to track the internet data movements and demographic shifts in the post Covid era and analyse the future proposals as part of the infrastructure bill resolutions' impact on our future generations in this city of NYC and largely, the whole of the USA.
