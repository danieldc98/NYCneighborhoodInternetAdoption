# Conclusion

We have explored the relation of internet availability and various socioeconomic features of neighborhoods throughout the five boroughs of New York City. We have discovered some of concerning discrepancies with internet availability regarding Mayor de Blasio's Internet Master Plan announced in 2020.

Regarding internet coverage around the city we can see that the best internet coverage is in Manhattan. Staten Island and Brooklyn have mid to high level internet adoption while Queens comes in slightly higher than the Bronx, but both at the bottom of the list. We came to this conclusion using data on internet adoption and availability, internet speed availability, public hot spot availability and mobile internet dependency. 

When looking at the distribution of of internet across New York City, one of the most concerning findings is the relation of mean income and internet availability and adoption. Referring to the graph above we can see that overall, a higher income in a neighborhood correlates with better internet availability and adoption. This signifies a continued socioeconomic imbalance of internet adoption in New York City. This trend is especially evident in The Bronx with the highest poverty rates, lowest income and the lowest internet adoption and availability, contrasted with Manhattan, with the highest income levels as well as the best internet coverage and adoption. 

When looking at other Socioeconomic features of New York City, we can see this concerning trend reinforced. There are several demographic features that are closely correlated in society: number of children is correlated to poverty rates, rental prices and home values are correlated to income and often times, we see that areas of cities are predominantly made up of one race/ethnicity. These correlations are reinforced by our findings and show that the internet adoption and availability trends are correlated with these features as well. 

Our findings are concerning when looking at the goal of Mayor de Blasio's Internet Master Plan (equitable internet access across New York City for everyone). these changes may have been stifled by the COVID 19 pandemic, nonetheless, we can see that the "aggressive infrastructure bill" has failed to meet its goals thus far.
