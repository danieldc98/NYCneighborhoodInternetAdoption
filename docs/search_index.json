To expand the access of the broadband, proper planning and detailed split of money and resources needs to be determined. Trends Affecting Internet Connectivity Modern American society has reached a point where the Internet is a driver of the economy and increasingly a necessity of modern life. Consequently, there has been a rapid expansion of Internet infrastructure and availability around the country. However, this expansion has not progressed uniformly across society. Certain digital divides still exist between urban, suburban and rural America. Research studies highlight that 72% Rural Americans say that they own a home broadband internet connection however the rural residents go online less frequently than their urban counterparts. [Research survey done of U.S. adults from Jan 25, 2021 to Feb 8, 2021 by Pew Research Center]. Almost half of the people who did not have a broadband connection said they could not afford it. Only 7% blamed the main reason to be, the lack of access to high-speed networks. It is less likely that rural adults have multiple devices like smartphone, tablet, laptop and computers in contrast to suburban and urban adults those who own multiple devices or services that help them to go online. 3 out of 10 adults rural community members report owning multiple devices like a desktop / laptop, a smartphone, a home broadband connection &amp; a tablet computer, in comparison to 44% urban &amp; 43% suburban adults. 8 out of 10 people who live in rural communities mentioned they use the internet at least on a daily basis, versus 9 out of 10 of those in urban areas. Digital Divide beyond Internet Adoption According to a long term study done by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration under the aegis of United States Department of Commerce, analyzed the digital divide by Educational Attainment and Population Density, Family Income, Race &amp; Ethnicity and Location. Internet use at particular locations, and participation in online activities. Based on the results they obtained, its evident that there is a continuing need to address the obstacles rural residents face in Internet use. For example, certain homes may need subsidies to make the Internet more affordable, while others may require training sessions on digital literacy to leverage the Internet. Even till this date, few remote rural communities still lack Internet access at all / poor service available or restrictively high priced. Around 81% rural areas are plugged into broadband, as against 86% in urban households, as per the Census Bureau data. But 13.6 Million urban households without a connection, is approximately 3 times as big as the 4.6 Million rural households that don’t have one. Motivation to Analyze NYC trends For all the above reasons stated, and to know more about the internet adoption trends across households in NYC and the wonderful city we are part of, our hypothesis is that there may be inequity in Internet availability and adoption, especially in a city as stratified as New York City. This motivated us to choose and further deepdive on this topic. We intend to explore how Internet availability, adoption, and usage vary across New York City. "],["proposal.html", "Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic 2.2 Data availability", " Chapter 2 Proposal Problem Statement to Analyze Is there a trend in Internet adoption across New York City based on demographic data? 2.1 Research topic Inspiration and Approach To identify and analyse the problem statement, we intend to use NYC’s Internet Master Plan: Adoption and Infrastructure Data by Neighborhood data to look at dozens of variables related to Internet speed, reliability, usage, and physical infrastructure at a neighborhood level. Collected by NYC’s Office of Technology and Innovation (OTI), this dataset contains detailed breakdowns of the state of Internet infrastructure and usage by city-recognized neighborhood. These range from obvious indicators of Internet usage (“Mobile Dependent Households (Percentage of Households)”) to detailed accountings of infrastructure (“Number of Free Public Wi-Fi Access Points in a Pedestrian Corridor”) to really detailed accountings of infrastructure (“Density of Poles Reserved and with Equipment Installed for Mobile Telecom Franchise”). As most digital public infrastructure must go through OTI for permits and oversight, we expect this data to offer an accurate accounting of the city’s digital infrastructure. Furthermore, since OTI last updated this dataset in March of 2021, we expect this dataset to offer insights into Internet access during the Covid-19 pandemic, when the importance of online connectivity was at an all-time high. In order to understand more about the neighborhoods making up the rows of the Internet Master Plan dataset, we intend to combine it with NYC’s Demographic Profiles of ACS 5 Year Estimates at the Neighborhood Tabulation Area (NTA) level. Collected by the Department of City Planning (DCP), this dataset describes in detail the unique demographic, economic, housing, and social characteristics of every neighborhood within the Five Boroughs. Keyed on the same Neighborhood Tabulation Area codes as the Internet dataset, this data answers questions about each neighborhood’s racial, ethnic, and linguistic diversity; their income and wealth distributions; their housing stock, rents, and densities; and their familial, educational, and disability chararacteristics. These categorical and continuous variables will add valuable context to each neighborhood’s Internet availability and adoption — giving us an opportunity to explore and visualize patterns and correlations between the two. One limitation of this dataset is its recency. Aggregated over five years in the mid 2010s, this data is 5 years staler than the Internet Master Plan data. While this may bias our findings as they relate to neighborhoods that have undergone rapid demographic change during that interval, we do not expect this to invalidate our overall findings. 2.2 Data availability Dataset Sources Internet Master Plan: Adoption and Infrastructure Data by Neighborhood: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Internet-Master-Plan-Adoption-and-Infrastructure-D/fg5j-q5nk Demographic Profiles of ACS 5 Year Estimates at the Neighborhood Tabulation Area (NTA) level https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Demographic-Profiles-of-ACS-5-Year-Estimates-at-th/8cwr-7pqn Both datasets are available on NYC OpenData either as a .csv file or as a zipped folder of .xlsx files. The Internet and demographic datasets both have 195 neighborhood rows with around 100 and around 4,000 variable columns, respectively. Per-factor statistics breakdowns on many-factored categorical data cause the demographic dataset’s high width. While we considered using several more recent NYC demographic datasets, we chose this one because of its thoroughness and mutual Neighborhood Tabulation Area structure with the Internet dataset. Since they are both under 6 MB, we were able to download the files using conventional HTTPS file downloads. To preprocess our data, we will read in the csv and excel files and combine them all on NTA code before writing the result out as a single csv file. This will enable us to effectively analyze and visualize any combination of the many categorical and continuous variables about Internet connectivity or socioeconomic demographics for all neighborhoods in New York City. Statistics about the Internet Master Plan dataset: - Includes Key indicators of broadband adoption, service and infrastructure in New York City.
