# Introduction

**Trends Affecting NYC Internet Connectivity**

Modern American society has reached a point where the Internet is a driver of the economy and increasingly a necessity of modern life. 
Consequently, there has been a rapid expansion of Internet infrastructure and availability around the country. However, this expansion has not progressed uniformly across society. 
For this reason our hypothesis is that there may be inequity in Internet availability and adoption, especially in a city as stratified as New York City. We intend to explore how Internet availability, adoption, and usage vary across New York City.
