# Interactive component

Building Interactive components in D3.js, we wish to demonstrate the interactivity and visualization capability particularly looking at the graphs of total NYC Neighborhood population along with Home Broadband User percentage in different boroughs.To limit the number of neighborhood and quick identification, we have a feature of Sort by Population & Sort by Percentage for better illustration.

The audience is free to sort them and hover on the bars for absorbing quick insights and navigating the visualizations.

Really interesting and cool to see the Upper West Side (composing our Columbia University) at the forefront !
