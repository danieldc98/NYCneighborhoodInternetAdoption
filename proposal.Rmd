**Problem Statement to Analyze**

Is there a trend in Internet adoption across New York City based on demographic data?


## Research topic

**Inspiration and Approach**

To identify and analyse the problem statement, we intend to use NYC's [Internet Master Plan: Adoption and Infrastructure Data by Neighborhood](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Internet-Master-Plan-Adoption-and-Infrastructure-D/fg5j-q5nk) data to look at dozens of variables related to Internet speed, reliability, usage, and physical infrastructure at a neighborhood level. 
Collected by NYC's Office of Technology and Innovation (OTI), this dataset contains detailed breakdowns of the state of Internet infrastructure and usage by city-recognized neighborhood. 
These range from obvious indicators of Internet usage ("Mobile Dependent Households (Percentage of Households)") to detailed accountings of infrastructure ("Number of Free Public Wi-Fi Access Points in a Pedestrian Corridor") to *really* detailed accountings of infrastructure ("Density of Poles Reserved and with Equipment Installed for Mobile Telecom Franchise"). 
As most digital public infrastructure must go through OTI for permits and oversight, we expect this data to offer an accurate accounting of the city's digital infrastructure. 
Furthermore, since OTI last updated this dataset in March of 2021, we expect this dataset to offer insights into Internet access during the Covid-19 pandemic, when the importance of online connectivity was at an all-time high.

In order to understand more about the neighborhoods making up the rows of the Internet Master Plan dataset, we intend to combine it with NYC's [Demographic Profiles of ACS 5 Year Estimates at the Neighborhood Tabulation Area (NTA) level](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Demographic-Profiles-of-ACS-5-Year-Estimates-at-th/8cwr-7pqn). 
Collected by the Department of City Planning (DCP), this dataset describes in detail the unique demographic, economic, housing, and social characteristics of every neighborhood within the Five Boroughs. Keyed on the same Neighborhood Tabulation Area codes as the Internet dataset, this data answers questions about each neighborhood's racial, ethnic, and linguistic diversity; their income and wealth distributions; their housing stock, rents, and densities; and their familial, educational, and disability chararacteristics. 
These categorical and continuous variables will add valuable context to each neighborhood's Internet availability and adoption â€” giving us an opportunity to explore and visualize patterns and correlations between the two. One limitation of this dataset is its recency. Aggregated over five years in the mid 2010s, this data is 5 years staler than the Internet Master Plan data. 
While this may bias our findings as they relate to neighborhoods that have undergone rapid demographic change during that interval, we do not expect this to invalidate our overall findings.


## Data availability

**Dataset Sources**

 - Internet Master Plan: Adoption and Infrastructure Data by Neighborhood:
 https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Internet-Master-Plan-Adoption-and-Infrastructure-D/fg5j-q5nk
 - Demographic Profiles of ACS 5 Year Estimates at the Neighborhood Tabulation Area (NTA) level
 https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Demographic-Profiles-of-ACS-5-Year-Estimates-at-th/8cwr-7pqn

Both datasets are available on [NYC OpenData](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us) either as a .csv file or as a zipped folder of .xlsx files.

- The Internet and demographic datasets both have 195 neighborhood rows with around 100 and around 4,000 variable columns, respectively. 
- Per-factor statistics breakdowns on many-factored categorical data cause the demographic dataset's high width.  
- While we considered using several more recent NYC demographic datasets, we chose this one because of its thoroughness and mutual Neighborhood Tabulation Area structure with the Internet dataset. 
- Since they are both under 6 MB, we were able to download the files using conventional HTTPS file downloads. To preprocess our data, we will read in the csv and excel files and combine them all on NTA code before writing the result out as a single csv file. 
- This will enable us to effectively analyze and visualize any combination of the many categorical and continuous variables about Internet connectivity or socioeconomic demographics for all neighborhoods in New York City.

**Statistics about the Internet Master Plan dataset:**
- Includes Key indicators of broadband adoption, service and infrastructure in New York City.

- Data Provided by - Office of Technology and Innovation (OTI)
- Dataset Owner - NYC OpenData
- Update Frequency - Annually
- Date Made Public - 12/09/2019
- Metadata Last Updated - September 23, 2022

**Statistics about the Demographic Profiles dataset:**
- Includes 4 profiles include demographics, economic, housing and sociological.

- Data Provided by - Department of City Planning (DCP)
- Dataset Owner - NYC OpenData
- Update Frequency - Annually
- Date Made Public - 05/29/2018

Together, these two datasets should allow us to explore how and why some New Yorkers enjoy world-class, ubiquitous access to the so-called information superhighway, while others still struggle to find any on ramps.
