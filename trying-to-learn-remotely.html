Referring to the graph above we can see that overall, a higher income in a neighborhood correlates with better internet availability and adoption. This signifies a continued socioeconomic imbalance of internet adoption in New York City. This trend is especially evident in The Bronx with the highest poverty rates, lowest income and the lowest internet adoptiona nd availability, contrasted with Manhattan, with the highest income levels as well as the best internet coverage and adoption.</a></li>

<p>When the Covid-19 pandemic forced society to a standstill, one of our most significant fears was its effect on children. Worries over the drops in children’s learning and development of social skills loomed large in parents’ thoughts, while schools muddled through teaching their students as best they could. While hard for all students, some faced more difficulties than others. Sadly, neighborhoods with the most children used some of the least reliable Internet in the city.</p>
<p><img src="finalproj_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-23-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>There was a clear negative correlation between youth population and home broadband adoption. Much of this connection could be attributed to relatively child-free and better-off Manhattan’s high broadband adoption. Following the time-worn connection between poverty, geography, and childbirth rates, New York neighborhoods raising a greater portion of children were the same neighborhoods with the lowest adoption of wired home Internet. For children who might not have yet been old enough to have their own cell phones, this might have meant reliance on a parent’s phone hotspot to attend class or do homework.</p>
<p><img src="finalproj_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-24-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>If a child had to attend class remotely, then perhaps they might have been able to use a public Wi-Fi network? Unfortunately, during the pandemic, city network access points were more likely to be available in neighborhoods with fewer children. Many of the most youthful neighborhoods had 0 public hotspots at all. For students to learn effectively during Zoom school, many were not able to turn to public Wi-Fi in their neighborhood.</p>
<p><img src="finalproj_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-25-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Even excluding the high number of public hotspots in the city’s Manhattan central business districts, public network connections were still more likely to be in neighborhoods with a smaller portion of children. The result was a city Internet infrastructure ill-equipped to accommodate students’ transition to virtual learning.</p>
<p>Income and Internet Trends:
<img src="finalproj_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-26-1.png" width="672" />
In the above graphs we can see a comparison of income levels (by borough) and several internet availability measures. The black line on each graph represents the trend between income and the respective measure of internet. The colors represent the boroughs and each dot is a neighborhood within the borough.</p>
<p>As we can see from the data, Manhattan seems to be the borough with the highest income. The green dots tend to be further right and away from the other boroughs demonstrating that trend. The rest of the boroughs are relatively close together regarding their income. We see this in looking at the clusters in each graph.</p>
<p>Now, looking at internet trends with regards to internet availability, there are some significant patterns to be aware of. First of all, when looking at the black trend line we can see that they are all positive trends except the top right graph representing mobile dependent households. For the other five comparisons, this signifies that higher incomes are correlated with better internet. Whether it be more public Wi-Fi hot-spots, faster internet, more selection with internet providers, or higher mobile and household internet adoption. As for the top right graph showing the negative trend. This is because mobile dependency is the inverse of better internet coverage. If more households are mobile dpendent it means they do not have internet in their and therefore a lower internet adoption rate.</p>
<p>Looking at these trends we can see that internet adoption is positively correlated to income level. As the higher the income the more available internet is in each neighborhood.</p>
<p>Significant Trend in The Bronx:
<img src="finalproj_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-27-1.png" width="672" />
This graph represents families below the poverty line in each neighborhood compared to high speed internet availability. According to the US Census, the poverty line in the United States is annual income below $33,000. As for the y-axis variable, this represents the percentage of blocks in a neighborhood that have access to internet speeds of 900 Mbps or higher. This high speed internet is crucial for businesses operating several internet-dependent pieces of technology at once as well as any household with a large number of connected devices.</p>
<p>As we can see from the chart The Bronx seems to be isolated from the other boroughs. No neighborhood in The Bronx has complete access to internet speeds greater than 900 Mbps. Also, we see neighborhoods int he Bronx being further right on the graph than neighborhoods in other boroughs. This signifies more families below the poverty line compared to the other boroughs. These two factors again reinforce the idea that economic status and internet adoption are correlated.</p>
